This simple web crawler made using solely Java is all about taking in a web link as well as a specified wanted level as an input and outputting the number of links found given the web link. It essentially "digs" into the file to display other weblinks up until the specified wanted level as been reached. 

Although this was a solo project, I did gain help and advice from peers alike and a lot of collaboration actually went into making this project work. There was not a shared code-base, rather, there was a shared mindset and how the web crawler was going to work.

Through out the course of working on this simple project I had learned so much. From extracting links given from an HTML document, using regular expressions to filter through the given input and find web addresses, and using everything up until this point, feeding everything into a breadth-first search and depth-first search algorithm to display the wanted output, there was a lot to process. Many new ideas and advanced subjects were brought up at the time since the highest ICS course I had under my belt was only ICS 111 (Intro to Java). I was doing the project concurrently with my enrollment in ICS 211 (Data Structures). The hardest part of this project was definitely the implementation of the graph traversal algorithms which was more formally introduced to me the following semester in my ICS 311 (Algorithms) course.
