## A Familiar Setting
As new of an experience RadGrad is for me, many of the features seen in this great platform have already been implemented into my life as a CS student here at UH Manoa. 
The degree planner is one of the things that I have been using prior to RadGrad which is an excellent way of keeping me on track to finishing my degree and getting the 
career I strive for. There are also tons of career options to browse through here, and it does seem overwhelming at times to pick and choose what I may want to do in the 
future, but that is what college is all about. Experimenting and trying new things to figure out what I want in life. I have seen many of the presented opportunities, careers,
and interests, however, I still do not know what I may want to pursue on this current track. 

## Nothing is Set in Stone
Although I am a highly goal-oriented person, that does not mean that I have a clear-cut route to achieving my goals. 
As of now, my short/mid-term goal is to finish this degree with the ultimate goal of landing a great and stable job in the field of software engineering after college. 
RadGrad has shown me how diverse the career pool is for a CS major, and that is troubling for me because I am indecisive and do not know which to pick. 
I think this may be because I am still a second year in the program without much experience or courses under my belt just yet.
