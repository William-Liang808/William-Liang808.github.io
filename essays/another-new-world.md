<h2>Hello JavaScript</h2>
JavaScript is not like another familiar-sounding coding language that we may know of as Java. The simplicity of JavaScript allows us for quicker coding and implementation rather than being caught up in the nitty-gritty parts of setting everything up. The lack of boilerplate text is a huge plus for pushing out fast and effective code. 

My previous experience with JavaScript comes from a high school introduction in my stem class. The course only went over the basics of JavaScript, much like any short introductions, only the basics were run through the course and I gained knowledge of how arrays, loops, and functions worked as well as the overall surface of how JavaScript works. 

<h2>A Look Back on ES6</h2>
This new module presented in the course really opened up my eyes to how in-depth JavaScript can really be and how much it has to offer as a programming language. The incorporation of ES6 really streamlines the javascript coding experience. Everything in ES6 was foreign and exciting, I have not seen anything like it before so it did present a bit of a learning curve in the beginning. It still is an obstacle that I have to get over and practice a lot to get used to the new conventions of ES6 and how to properly and effectively use it. JavaScript is a such great language to have under your belt especially since it is such a dominant language when it comes to the web. The functionality of it is nearly endless.

<h2>Brain Train</h2>
Another great learning tool to use is a thing called Workouts Of the Day, aka, WODs. It is an athletic software engineering approach that fosters a better learning environment. WODs really promote working under a time-sensitive pressure that will be presented in the real world. It is stressful, but it also incentivizes me to study more and know what I am doing in order to be able to pass within a certain amount of time presented especially since they are all or nothing. I find them enjoyable since WODs are not impossible to do within an 8 minute time span at the latest. I believe that WODs will work well to benefit me as a software engineer.
