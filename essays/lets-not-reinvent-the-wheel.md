## My Very First Framework

Prior to taking Software Engineering (ICS 314), I have never incorporated a UI framework such as Semantic UI. It really is eye-opening to realize that most, if not all the things that I have made in HTML and CSS can be easily done with a few framework class calls. The simplicity and convenient design of a well-made framework can speed up the process of making just about anything I want. I really can start off by saying that Semantic UI is awesome! 

## Semantic VS Raw HTML/CSS

So, what's the difference between a website incorporating a UI framework compared to a website using just raw HTML and CSS? The result is almost day and night.

The differences are very noticeable between these two web pages. With semantic UI I am able to make a navbar with the call of a few classes assigned to my div tags. The same navbar that was created in raw HTML & CSS can be done better and in fewer lines of code. It also looks more pleasing to the eyes than the site built in raw HTML & CSS which is displayed as the first image shown. By creating the site without a framework, our creation is very limited to what it can look like. 

## Advantages

As said in my title, we should not have to reinvent the wheel when it comes to UI design since a lot has already been built for us through the amazing and free frameworks. Need a nice menu? Semantic has it. What about a button with a heart icon in the center? You do not need to know how to make it with raw HTML & CSS because the Semantic framework also has it under its various libraries. With Semantic the possibilities are endless. The features of Semantic is well documented and I was able to find just about everything I need to create an amazing-looking webpage with a little amount of coding in HTML and CSS. I believe that with enough time and effort given to learn a framework such as Semantic UI, the returns it will provide will be much greater in the short and long term. 

## Disadvantages

You may finish whatever work you may have a little too fast. If you're getting paid by the hour, this may be the only downside that I see. Other than that, in my opinion there are no disadvantages to using a framework such as Semantic.
