We have all heard the phrase "there are no bad questions" in our lives or some derivation of that phrase. Turns out, that is far from the truth depending on the way you look at what is considered a "bad question". There are also many factors to consider when asking a "good question" that does not only pertain to the field of software engineering. This is not only applicable outside the realm of tech, but also in our daily lives. 

## What Constitutes As a Good Question?
In Eric Steven Raymond’s article all about asking “good” and “bad” questions, they give a good basic understanding of what constitutes as a “good” or “bad” question. There are many criteria that are involved when asking a “good” question. It can be broken up into two categories; ‘before you ask’ and ‘when you ask.’

### Before You Ask
Before you ask a question, one of the first things that you should do is Google your question. Google different variations of that question as well to try and find the answer you’re looking for. As a person who does not like constantly asking others for help, this was my go-to solution for most, if not all my problems and I have always managed to get the answer I look for through a few searches. 

This is Raymond’s guidelines to smart questions prior to actually asking:  
```
1. Try to find an answer by searching the archives of the forum or mailing list you plan to post to.

2. Try to find an answer by searching the Web.

3. Try to find an answer by reading the manual.

4. Try to find an answer by reading a FAQ.

5. Try to find an answer by inspection or experimentation.

6. Try to find an answer by asking a skilled friend.

7. If you're a programmer, try to find an answer by reading the source code.
```
Now that you have established that your question checks out with the ‘before you ask’ category, we can move onto the ‘when you ask’ category. 

### When You Ask
When asking a question on whatever forum or discussion site of your choice, you should consider Raymond’s following guidelines for DONT’S when asking a question: 
``` 
1. Do not post your question to a forum where it's off topic

2. Do not post a very elementary question to a forum where advanced technical questions are expected, or vice-versa

3. Do not cross-post to too many different newsgroups

4. Do not post a personal e-mail to somebody who is neither an acquaintance of yours nor personally responsible for solving your problem
```
