We have all heard the phrase "there are no bad questions" in our lives or some derivation of that phrase. Turns out, that is far from the truth depending on the way you look at what is considered a "bad question". There are also many factors to consider when asking a "good question" that does not only pertain to the field of software engineering. This is not only applicable outside the realm of tech, but also in our daily lives. 

## What Constitutes As a Good Question?
In Eric Steven Raymond’s article all about asking “good” and “bad” questions, they give a good basic understanding of what constitutes as a “good” or “bad” question. There are many criteria that are involved when asking a “good” question. It can be broken up into two categories; ‘before you ask’ and ‘when you ask.’

### Before You Ask
Before you ask a question, one of the first things that you should do is Google your question. Google different variations of that question as well to try and find the answer you’re looking for. As a person who does not like constantly asking others for help, this was my go-to solution for most, if not all my problems and I have always managed to get the answer I look for through a few searches. 

This is Raymond’s guidelines to smart questions prior to actually asking:  
```
1. Try to find an answer by searching the archives of the forum or mailing 
   list you plan to post to.

2. Try to find an answer by searching the Web.

3. Try to find an answer by reading the manual.

4. Try to find an answer by reading a FAQ.

5. Try to find an answer by inspection or experimentation.

6. Try to find an answer by asking a skilled friend.

7. If you're a programmer, try to find an answer by reading the source code.
```
Now that you have established that your question checks out with the ‘before you ask’ category, we can move onto the ‘when you ask’ category. 

### When You Ask
When asking a question on whatever forum or discussion site of your choice, you should consider Raymond’s following guidelines for DONT’S when asking a question: 
``` 
1. Do not post your question to a forum where it's off topic

2. Do not post a very elementary question to a forum where advanced technical
   questions are expected, or vice-versa

3. Do not cross-post to too many different newsgroups

4. Do not post a personal e-mail to somebody who is neither an acquaintance of
   yours nor personally responsible for solving your problem
```

Furthermore, when asking, your header in your question should contain no jargon with a clear and precise problem that you would want to be answered. Let's now jump into analyzing our first Stack Overflow questions. 

## The Bad
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66285742/can-i-do-anything-to-make-my-webscraper-look-better">This post</a> is a fairly bad question and there are a few things that we can point out through Raymond’s guidelines of to do and what not to do. 

Let me briefly go over what the post is about and what they asked. Someone posted a question titled "Can i do anything to make my webscraper look better?" and followed up the post with 
> I got my desired output, but it is all over the place, how do I make it cleaner?
As well as a few screenshots of their code and output. 

One of the big red flags present in this question posted is the subjective header pertaining to the phrases “look better” and "how do I make it cleaner". What may look better to me may not look better to others and this ambiguity leaves a lot hanging. It is not explicit at all. 

Someone on the forum even asked
> Define "cleaner"
which is a clear sign of an implicit question that could have been built upon more. Perhaps they could have asked, "How do I remove white space from a string" which is what they may have meant in the first place. 

## The Good
A great question that I have come across can be found <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1144783/how-to-replace-all-occurrences-of-a-string-in-javascript">here.</a> 

The question posted is titled “How to replace all occurrences of a string in JavaScript”. With a post header that cuts to the point with an explicit and meaningful question, followed up with what they have already done, and further expands on what they would like to see as the output, this is embodies the characteristics of a smart question.

## The Conclusion
With everything being said, it is clear from both examples that “bad” questions may result in “bad” and inefficient responses. Vice-versa for “good” questions. The result of this analysis of both Stack Overflow questions really highlights how much of an important asset it is to be good at communicating your questions across to others and how to properly do so. Not just as a software engineer, but as a person who wants their questions answered no matter what the subject is. Communication as a student is one of the most important skills we need.
